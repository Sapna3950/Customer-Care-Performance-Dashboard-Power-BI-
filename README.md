## 🚀 An interactive dashboard project to monitor and improve customer service using AI-powered conversation data in the telecom sector.
## 🧠 Project Objective
To analyze and improve customer experience in the telecom sector by tracking query trends, token usage, language distribution, failure reasons, and bot response success rates using Power BI.

### 💼 Business Problem
## Telecom companies face challenges in maintaining high-quality, responsive customer care. This project addresses:
 * High bot failure rates
* Language-specific service gaps
* Token inefficiencies in AI models
* query category delays

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* Power BI: For dashboard development
* DAX: For creating measures and insights
* SQL: (Optional) For data extraction and transformation
* excel/CSV: Data source.

## 📍 Key Insights from the Dashboard
## 📌 Page 1: Trends and Insights of the Company 🌍 Overview at a Glance

*📈 Total Queries peaked in March (250), showing a significant increase in customer interaction.
*🔍 Bot Success Rate is high at 85.34%, while failure is only 9.45% – a positive sign!
*🧾 Average Tokens Per Query increased to 156 in April, indicating longer/more complex interactions.
*💬 GPT Token Usage dominated over Ada Tokens, suggesting a shift towards advanced AI handling.

## 🔍 What You See
📅 A bar chart showing monthly queries
🎯 Donut chart for success vs failure
🌐 Language usage in a colorful bar chart
🧠 Token usage comparison: GPT vs Ada

## 🧠 What It Means
🔥 March had the highest activity — something big happened!
✅ Most queries were successful, only a few failed (great job chatbot!)
🗣️ English dominates, other languages are rare
💸 GPT used way more tokens than Ada (more complex questions)

## 🟩 Page 2: 🔎 Where It Fails and Why
## 🔍 What You See
🌍 A deeper dive into language usage
⚠️ A bar chart showing top reasons queries fail
⏱️ Average response time for different query types

## 🧠 What It Means
🗨️ English is super dominant, but we see some activity in Hindi, Telugu, Arabic
🛠️ Common failures: internal errors, timeouts, and unsupported inputs
🐢 Some query types like RAG take longer to respond

## 🟨 Page 3: 💰 Token Insights + Query Performance
## 🔍 What You See
📊 GPT vs Ada token usage per query type
🧩 Failure breakdown per language
🟢 Query success vs failure by type

## 🧠 What It Means
💸 GPT tokens are used more in complex queries — be mindful of cost
🔎 Some languages (e.g., Arabic, Telugu) face more failures
📉 Certain query types fail more often — time to optimize them!

## 🧩 Features of the Dashboard
✅ KPIs with clear value indicators
✅ Time-series analysis of queries & token usage
✅ Dynamic filters by month, language, and query type
✅ Failure reason drill-down with date-level slicing
✅ Heatmap and trend lines for token consumption
